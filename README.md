# adoon-number-frame

This repository, `adoorn-number-frame`, is owned by [f1fe](https://github.com/f1fe) and is primarily written in OpenSCAD. While a project description is not provided, the repositoryâ€™s name and primary language suggest its purpose is related to designing or generating a "number frame" (potentially a structural or display frame) using OpenSCAD, a script-based 3D CAD modeling tool.

## Features

- **OpenSCAD-Based**: The project leverages OpenSCAD for 3D modeling, making it suitable for parametric and programmable design.
- **Customizable**: As with most OpenSCAD projects, parameters can likely be adjusted to create different sizes or styles of number frames.
- **Public Repository**: The project is open to the public and available for forking, issues, and contributions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/f1fe/adoorn-number-frame.git
   ```
2. **Open in OpenSCAD**:
   - Launch [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/).
   - Open the `.scad` files from this repository.
3. **Customize Parameters**:
   - Modify script parameters as needed to fit your requirements.
4. **Render and Export**:
   - Use OpenSCAD to render the model and export it for 3D printing or further use.
